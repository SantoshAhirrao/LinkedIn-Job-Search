# LinkedIn-Job-Search

Dear All, I have experienced how difficult it is to find a job through various websites and keep track of all the one applied, have to apply, follow up etc. I tried to simplify this task by making a simple web scraper, which can scrape the LinkedIn site and output all your job requirements in a simple csv file, which you can use to track your further activities. This code can be used for job search from other websites also with slight modification. It's available on my github repo, titled "LinkedIn Job Search. Try It !!! your suggestions and comments are welcomed to improve it further ?
